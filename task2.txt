            //.......... task (2) for the day two..........// 



    1.]   //....  List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs  ....


  ..... node js ......

  // 1.) Node doesn’t have a predefined “window” object cause it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.
  //2.) “location” object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn’t require that.
  //3.) Ofcourse Node doesn’t have “document” object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.
  //4.) Node has “global”, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
  //5.) “require” object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app
 

   //.......... Browser js(Console) ...............

    //1.) “window” is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
    //2.) “location” is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.
    //3.) “document”, which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.
    //4.) Browsers may have an object named “global”, but it will be the exact one as “window”.
    //5.) Browsers don’t have “require” predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.
    //6.) Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers

  // ..In java script that we can use [var]
     [ex]:
           var  x = 56;
     In javascript we need not worry about what the x is.
 // .. In javascript we add the function in between the running time 
       and easy to run the code .
 // .. In java script it will compile the code one time  easily.
  // .. In java script that the function can change in every were .
  // .. In javascript t it can optimize .
  // .. In java script that compile  one or more codes.

  // ... In Es5 variable  should created and then it should be return. 
  // ... In Es6 it will create variable and immediately return the key.

    // ... Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

    // ... For example 

     var hello = {
  word : 'world';
  letter(){
     console.log(`letter from ${this.word}`);
  }
}

myObject.word();
